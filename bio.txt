Scott Moser is a technical lead on the Ubuntu Server and Cloud team at
Canonical.  He works on cloud-like things such as cloud-init, Ubuntu cloud
images, OpenStack and cirrOS.  He has more experience with programming in 'sh'
than you probably care to hear about.

The talk on shell scripting^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^programming will discuss ways to make
your shell scripts less brittle, and more performant.  And will also try to
